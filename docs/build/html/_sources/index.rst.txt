Welcome to EM Image Segmentation's documentation!
=================================================

This documentation tries to explain better the code of the project `EM Image Segmentation <https://github.com/danifranco/DeepLearning_EM>`_, which is used to make semantic segmentation using U-Net based architecture for EM images. The code is based on Keras and TensorFlow as backend.

Some of state-of-the-art approaches have been reproduced and implemented to compare our method in a more robust way, with the goal of supplement the lack of information in some of those works.
