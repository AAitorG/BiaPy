Welcome to EM Image Segmentation's documentation!
=================================================

This documentation tries to explain better the code of the project `EM Image Segmentation <https://github.com/danifranco/DeepLearning_EM>`_, which is used to make semantic segmentation for EM images. The code is based on Keras and TensorFlow as backend.
