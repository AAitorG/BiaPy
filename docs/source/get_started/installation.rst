Installation
------------

BiaPy library can be run in three different ways: using `Docker <docker.html>`_, `Google Colab <colab.html>`_ or via command line. 

After any of the following choices go to `Configuration <configuration.html>`_ page where you will find how to create the configuration file 
that BiaPy needs to work.


Option A: Command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For command line usage you only need to set-up a ``conda`` environment. For that you need first to install `Anaconda/Miniconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ and then create an environment using the
file located in `utils/env/environment.yml <https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy/blob/master/utils/env/environment.yml>`_ ::
    
    conda env create -f utils/env/environment.yml

Next, you need to clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy.git 
    
The next step is to know how BiaPy works `here <configuration.html>`_.


Option B: Docker 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run Biapy using Docker you need to install it first `here <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_.

The next step is to know how BiaPy works `here <configuration.html>`_.


Option C: Colab
