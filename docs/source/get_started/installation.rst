Installation
------------

BiaPy can be locally installed/run on any Linux, Windows and Mac OS platform using `Docker <docker.html>`_ or via command line (with Anaconda/Miniconda and Git). Alternatively, the BiaPy can also be used on `Google Colab <colab.html>`_.


Command line installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For command line usage, you only need to set-up a ``conda`` environment. For that you first need to install `Anaconda/Miniconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ and then create an environment using the file located in `utils/env/environment.yml <https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy/blob/master/utils/env/environment.yml>`_ ::
    
    conda env create -f utils/env/environment.yml

Next, you need to clone the repository::

    git clone https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy.git
