[BiaPy](https://github.com/danifranco/BiaPy) is an open source Python library for building bioimage analysis pipelines. This repository is actively under development by the Biomedical Computer Vision group at the [University of the Basque Country](https://www.ehu.eus/en/en-home) and the [Donostia International Physics Center](http://dipc.ehu.es/). 

The library provides an easy way to create image processing pipelines that are typically used in the analysis of biology microscopy images in 2D and 3D. Namely, BiaPy contains ready-to-use solutions for the tasks of [semantic segmentation](https://biapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/semantic_segmentation.html), [instance segmentation](https://biapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/instance_segmentation.html), [object detection](https://biapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/detection.html), [image denoising](https://biapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/denoising.html), [single image super-resolution](https://biapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/super_resolution.html), [self-supervised learning](https://biapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/self_supervision.html) and [image classification](https://biapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows/classification.html). The source code is based on Keras/TensorFlow as backend. Given BiaPyâ€™s deep learning based core, a machine with a graphics processing unit (GPU) is recommended for fast training and execution.
