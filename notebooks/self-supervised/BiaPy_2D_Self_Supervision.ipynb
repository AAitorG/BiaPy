This way, the model learns a representation that can be later transferred to solve a downstream task in a labeled (but smaller) dataset. In BiaPy we adopt two pretext tasks that you will need to choose with **pretext_task** variable below. The pretext tasks implemented in BiaPy are these:\n","\n","* 'crappify': To recover a worstened version of the input image as in (see [Franco-Barranco et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260722003315)).\n","* 'masking': Random patches of the input image are masked and the network needs to reconstruct the missing pixels (see [He et al., 2022](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/He_Masked_Autoencoders_Are_Scalable_Vision_Learners_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)).\n","\n","The selection of the model and the pipeline hyperparameters can be configured by editing the YAML configuration file or (easier) by running the next cell.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Select your parameters**\n","---\n","#### **Name of the model**\n","* **`model_name`:** Use only my_model -style, not my-model (Use \"_\" not \"-\"). Do not use spaces in the name. Avoid using the name of an existing model (saved in the same folder) as it will be overwritten.\n","* **`pretext_task`:** Pretext task to use to train the model. Options: 'crappify' to recover a worstened version of the input image as in (see [Franco-Barranco et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260722003315)) and 'masking', where random patches of the input image are masked and the network needs to reconstruct the missing pixels (see [He et al., 2022](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/He_Masked_Autoencoders_Are_Scalable_Vision_Learners_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf)). **Default value: 'crappify'**\n","\n","#### **Basic training parameters**\n","* **`number_of_epochs`:** Input how many epochs (rounds) the network will be trained. In this example we only use 100 epochs, but if 'masking' pretext task as selected thousand epochs are necessary to obtain good data representations.The MAE method represents a cutting-edge technique in the realm of semi-supervised learning (SSL), albeit with the trade-off of increased computational requirements and time constraints. With 'crappify' less better representations can be obtained but require less epochs too. **Default value: 100**\n","\n","* **`percentage_validation`:**  Input the percentage of your training dataset you want to use to validate the network during the training. **Default value: 10**\n","\n","* **`patience`:**  Input how many epochs you want to wait without the model improving its results in the validation set to stop training. **Default value: 20**\n","\n","#### **Advanced Parameters - experienced users only**\n","* **`model_architecture`:**  Select the architecture of the DNN used as backbone of the pipeline. Options: MAE, EDSR, RCAN, WDSR, DFCAN, U-Net, Residual U-Net, Attention U-Net, SEUNet, MultiResUNet, ResUNet++ (see [Franco-Barranco et al., 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-021-09556-1), UNETR-Mini, UNETR-Small and UNETR-Base. **Default value: U-Net**\n","\n","* **`batch_size:`** This parameter defines the number of patches seen in each training step. Reducing or increasing the **batch size** may slow or speed up your training, respectively, and can influence network performance. **Default value: 6**\n","\n","* **`patch_size`:** Input the size of the patches use to train your model (length in pixels in X and Y). The value should be smaller or equal to the dimensions of the image. **Default value: 256**\n","\n","* **`input_channels`:** Input the number of channels of your images (grayscale = 1, RGB = 3). **Default value: 1**\n","\n","* **`optimizer`:** Select the optimizer used to train your model. Options: ADAM, ADAMW, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). ADAM usually converges faster, while ADAMW provides a balance between fast convergence and better handling of weight decay regularization. SGD is known for better generalization. **Default value: ADAMW**\n","\n","* **`initial_learning_rate`:** Input the initial value to be used as learning rate. If you select ADAM as optimizer, this value should be around 10e-4. **Default value: 0.0001**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cfUyeHEP4vY3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@markdown ###Name of the

signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)\n","---\n","\n","First, it is good practice to evaluate the training progress by comparing the training loss with the validation loss. The latter is a metric which shows how well the network performs on a subset of unseen data which is set aside from the training dataset. For more information on this, see for example [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6381354/) by Nichols *et al.*\n","\n","**Training loss** describes an error value after each epoch for the difference between the model's prediction and its ground-truth target.\n","\n","**Validation loss** describes the same error value between the model's prediction on a validation image and compared to it's target.\n","\n","During training both values should decrease before reaching a minimal value which does not decrease further even after more training. Comparing the development of the validation loss with the training loss can give insights into the model's performance.\n","\n","Decreasing **Training loss** and **Validation loss** indicates that training is still necessary and increasing the `number_of_epochs` is recommended. Note that the curves can look flat towards the right side, just because of the y-axis scaling. The network has reached convergence once the curves flatten out. After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data. In other words the network is remembering the exact patterns from the training data and no longer generalizes well to unseen data. In this case the training dataset has to be increased.\n","\n","The **Peak signal-to-noise ratio** (PSNR) ratio is used as a quality measurement between the original and a reconstructed image. The **higher the PSNR, the better the quality** of the reconstructed image."],"metadata":{"id":"k4i0N2vOWUes"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#@markdown ##Play the cell to show a plot of training
